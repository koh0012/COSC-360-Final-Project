### Project Descriptions
<p>In this project, I will be developing personal blog website called “MyBlogPost”. He will be responsible in all areas in the project, such as implementing required site functionalities, both Frontend and Backend, as well as writing documentation. The website users will be able to sign-up, create a post, and make comments on posts. The website will be designed to support multiple users. Different website privileges will be given to users with respective to three user states, member, visitor, and administrator. For the implementation of the website, I will rely on vanilla technics such as HTML5, CSS, and Javascript for the client-side, and PHP, MySQL for the server-side implementation.</p>
